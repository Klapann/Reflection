# Reflection
Here's my reflection on the work I've done in this class

This was probably my hardest class this semester and I'll be completely honest by saying that I struggled with it heavily along with everything else I was doing. But what I really liked about this class was the fact that I actually learned something. Over the last year and a half I feel like I haven't learned anything in my online college courses so it made me really happy to finally be able to learn something and be sucessful in that. I remember being so proud of myself when my code actually worked, no matter how elementary it is or it seems. 

I wish in the end I could've put more work in to change my code a bit more on my old projects but I just didn't know how. I know what I know and I find it suprising that I even know anything about coding now, never thought I would understand a single bit of it. 

This part of what I wrote in my Manifesto back in August is really important to me as well because I think I kept to my word: "I want to be able to complete this semester with a strong idea of what coding is and how to do the basics in order to create something I can be proud of. I’m thinking this whole class may be a challenge for me but with determination I’m sure I’ll be able to put in the work and thought it takes to finish strong."

I wouldn't say that I have an extremely strong understanding of code but I do understand enough about it to feel like I've spent time learning about it and that I might be able to use it in the fututre with a bit more practice. I was also right about the class being a challenge and I wish I had realized that before we got to the end of the semster but it is what it is. 

What did dissapoint me about myself this semester in regards to this class was the fact that I never asked for help, which was another thing I stated in my manifesto. I don't like doing it and I was hoping that maybe I would but I barely asked a single qustion and that's just an issue on my side, if I could do anything diffirently it would have been being more dilligent and open to critism and change.
